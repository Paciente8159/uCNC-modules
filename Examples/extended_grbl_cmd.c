/*
	This is and example of how to add a custom Grbl system command extension to µCNC
	Extension system commands can be added simply by adding an event listener to the core parser

	GCode/MCode execution is done in 3 steps:
	  - Parsing - the code is read from the stream and it's parsed generating a new machine state
	  - Validation - the new machine is validated against some NIST/RS274 rules for incompatibilities
	  - Execution - The new state is executed and the active machine state is updated

	Every unrecognized system command can be intercepted before being discarded as an invalid command
	There is an event that can be hooked to do this.
